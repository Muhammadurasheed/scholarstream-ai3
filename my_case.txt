📚 ScholarStream
AI-Powered Financial Opportunity Hub for Students in Urgent Need
💡 Inspiration
March 2025. Everything fell apart.

I'm Rasheed, a petroleum engineering student at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria. I was supposed to graduate from University on December, 15, 2025. I had a 3.4 GPA, led GDSC Mobile, volunteered as a teacher on weekends. On paper, I was the "ideal scholarship candidate."

Then my family's income dropped 60%. My school fee deadline came and went. I watched it pass, helpless—sitting at home instead of in class.

The Frustrating Truth
I had skills to earn money. I'd been coding since 2021—React, Python, building projects for local businesses. But I didn't know opportunities existed:

Never heard of Devpost, Gitcoin, or bug bounties
Didn't know students were winning $5,000 in weekend hackathons
Didn't know about $500 bounties for fixing bugs in open-source projects
These weren't hidden—they were right there, waiting. I just didn't know where to look.

The Discovery That Changed Everything
After deferring my admission, I spent months exploring. I discovered an entire ecosystem:

🏆 Hackathons with $50,000 prize pools
🎓 Scholarships for first-generation students I perfectly qualified for
💰 Bounties for coding tasks I could complete in an afternoon
I was angry. Why was this information so scattered? Why did I stumble upon it by accident?

Then I realized: If I didn't know, how many other students are watching their dreams slip away right now?

The Shocking Statistics
💵 $2.9 billion in scholarships goes unclaimed every year (U.S. Department of Education)
🌐 Billions more in hackathon prizes, bounties, competitions, and emergency grants
🎯 Tens of billions of dollars that students miss because deadlines are scattered across 10,000+ websites
Our Promise
ScholarStream exists because I refuse to let another student experience what I did.

When you're facing a tuition deadline tomorrow, you don't need a scholarship that pays out in six months. You need to know there's:

A hackathon this weekend with $10,000 in prizes
A bounty you can complete today for $500
An emergency grant your university offers that nobody talks about
This isn't just a project. It's personal. It's a promise.

🎯 What It Does
ScholarStream is the first AI-powered financial opportunity hub designed specifically for students in urgent need.

We fundamentally reimagined what a "scholarship platform" should be. Traditional platforms are databases—you search, scroll, and leave empty-handed because everything takes months. We built an intelligent opportunity engine that understands context, urgency, and personalization.

🚀 Core Features
1️⃣ Intelligent Onboarding (2 minutes)
Conversational questions about your needs: "I need money urgently" vs. "Long-term planning"
Collect academic profile, skills, interests, background, and location
Real-time feedback: "Students with your profile typically match 120+ opportunities!"
2️⃣ Real-Time Discovery Engine
While you complete onboarding, our system springs to life:

🔍 Scrapes 100+ sources: Devpost, Gitcoin, MLH, Kaggle, Scholarships.com, university financial aid pages
🔌 Calls public APIs: Devpost API (200+ hackathons), Gitcoin API (150+ bounties)
🤖 AI-enriches data: Google Gemini structures messy scraped data into clean, usable information
✨ Matches to your profile: Intelligent algorithm considers skills, timeline, background, location
⚡ Delivers personalized results: Within 10 seconds, see 50-150 opportunities tailored to YOU
3️⃣ Multi-Opportunity Platform (Our Key Differentiation)
We don't just show scholarships. We show:

Type	Amount	Timeline	Use Case
🎓 Scholarships	$500-$50k	1-6 months	Long-term planning
💻 Hackathons	$100-$100k	Days-weeks	Immediate action
🎯 Bounties	$50-$10k	Hours-days	Urgent needs
🏆 Competitions	$100-$50k	Weeks-months	Skill-building
💰 Grants	$1k-$100k	Varies	Specific projects/needs
Each opportunity displays:

✅ Match score (0-100%): "You're an 87% match for Gates Scholarship"
⏰ Urgency indicator: "Deadline in 3 days" vs. "Apply anytime"
💵 Expected value: (Prize × Win Probability) / Time Required = $425/hour
🎯 Why you match: "Your GPA, major, and first-gen status make you a strong candidate"
4️⃣ AI Chat Assistant (The Game-Changer)
Example Conversation:

Student: "I need $500 urgently for textbooks by Friday"

ScholarStream AI: "Found 8 opportunities you can complete by Friday:

🔥 IMMEDIATE:

Gitcoin Bounty: Fix React bug - $500 (12 hours left, matches your React skills)
HackerOne: Find XSS vulnerability - $300 (rolling deadline, beginner-friendly)
📅 THIS WEEK:

ETHGlobal Mini-Hack: $5,000 prizes (submissions due Friday, solo or team)
Dev.to Challenge: Build any app - $3,000 pool (4 days left)
🚨 EMERGENCY OPTIONS:

Student Emergency Fund (University of Ibadan) - up to $2,000 (48-hour decision)
I've added these to your dashboard. Want help applying to the top 3?"

The AI understands:

🧠 Context: Knows you're a CS student, your skills, your timeline
⚡ Urgency: Prioritizes immediate opportunities when you say "urgent"
✅ Feasibility: Shows opportunities you can actually win (realistic match scores)
5️⃣ Smart Dashboard
Not just a list—an intelligent workspace:

🎚️ Type filters: Scholarships, Hackathons, Bounties, Competitions, Grants
🔥 Urgency sorting: "Closing today" gets top priority
📌 Bookmarking: Save opportunities, organize into folders
🔔 Live updates: "12 new opportunities discovered matching your profile"
📅 Calendar view: See all deadlines at a glance
💰 Financial impact tracker: "You've applied to $45k in opportunities"
6️⃣ Application Copilot (Coming Together)
We don't abandon you at "Apply Now":

📝 Universal application builder: Fill out once, adapt for multiple scholarships
✍️ AI essay assistant: Context-aware suggestions based on scholarship values
📄 Document management: Upload transcripts, resumes once—reuse everywhere
📋 Copy-paste helper: Pre-filled answers with copy buttons for external forms
📊 Application tracker: Draft → Submitted → Won, all in one place
7️⃣ Real-Time Web Discovery (Bleeding-Edge)
If our database doesn't have what you need, we search the web LIVE:

🔍 AI generates smart search queries based on your request
🕷️ Scrapes top results in real-time
🤖 Extracts opportunity details using Gemini
⚡ Returns results within 20 seconds
💾 Caches discoveries for other users
📊 The Impact
For a student like me:

🔍 Discovery: 3x more opportunities (from 50 to 150+)
⚡ Speed: Apply 5x faster with pre-filled data and AI help
🎯 Success: Higher win rates through better matching
🚨 Urgency: Find money-making opportunities TODAY, not in 6 months
This isn't just a scholarship database. It's a financial lifeline.

🛠️ How We Built It
🎨 Tech Stack
Frontend: Built for Beauty and Performance

🔷 React + TypeScript: Type safety prevents bugs, component architecture ensures maintainability
🎨 Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui: Consistent, accessible, beautiful design system
📱 Mobile-first responsive: Works flawlessly on phones (where most students browse)
Backend: Engineered for Intelligence
🐍 FastAPI (Python): Async-first framework, perfect for handling multiple scrapers concurrently
🔥 Firebase: Authentication, Firestore database, real-time updates
☁️ Cloudinary: Document storage and image optimization
🚀 Deployed on Vercel: Edge functions for global low-latency access
🤖 AI & Discovery Engine: The Secret Sauce
Problem 1: Getting Real Data
❌ Challenge: Couldn't use mock data—judges can smell fake demos.

✅ Solution: Multi-source aggregation

Public APIs first (fastest, most reliable):

Devpost API: 200+ active hackathons as JSON
Gitcoin API: 150+ open bounties with structured data
Kaggle API: Data science competitions with prizes
Web scraping second (broader coverage):

Playwright for JavaScript-heavy sites
BeautifulSoup for static HTML
Respectful scraping: 2-second delays, rotating user agents, comply with robots.txt
Live discovery third (for personalized searches):

Real-time web search when cached data insufficient
Scrape top 5 results, extract details with AI
Problem 2: Messy Data
❌ Challenge: Scraped data is a disaster—inconsistent formats, structures, and standards.

✅ Solution: AI-powered enrichment pipeline using Google Gemini 2.0 Flash

Input (messy):

"Women in STEM Scholarship by XYZ Foundation. We offer $5,000 
to female students pursuing STEM degrees. Must have 3.0 GPA. 
Deadline: December 15th. Essay required."
Output (structured):

{
  "name": "Women in STEM Scholarship",
  "organization": "XYZ Foundation",
  "amount": 5000,
  "amount_display": "$5,000",
  "deadline": "2025-12-15",
  "eligibility": {
    "gpa_min": 3.0,
    "majors": ["STEM"],
    "gender": "Female"
  },
  "requirements": {
    "essay": true,
    "recommendation_letters": 0
  },
  "tags": ["STEM", "Women", "Merit-Based"],
  "urgency": "future"
}
Critical optimization: Batch 10 opportunities per Gemini call to stay within free tier limits (15 RPM, 1500 RPD). This means 150 opportunities using only 15 API calls—well within quota.

Problem 3: Speed vs. Freshness
❌ Challenge: Real-time scraping takes 15-30 seconds. Users won't wait.

✅ Solution: Hybrid approach

Immediate results (cached, <1 second): Return 20-50 pre-scraped opportunities from Firebase
Background discovery (live, 10-30 seconds): Run live scraping in parallel while user browses
Progressive enhancement: New opportunities slide into dashboard as discovered
Scheduled refresh: Background job runs every 6 hours to keep database fresh
Problem 4: Intelligent Matching
❌ Challenge: Not all opportunities are equal for YOUR profile.

✅ Solution: Multi-factor scoring algorithm

For each opportunity, we calculate:

Factor	Weight	Points
Eligibility Match	50%	GPA (10) + Major (10) + Background (20) + Location (10)
Interest Alignment	20%	(matching_tags / total_tags) × 20
Financial Fit	15%	Award amount meets stated need
Feasibility	15%	Time investment + Competition level + Deadline
Final Score: 0-100%

🟢 80%+: Excellent match (green badge)
🟡 60-80%: Good match (yellow badge)
⚪ 40-60%: Fair match (gray badge)
⚫ <40%: Hidden from results (not worth user's time)
Problem 5: Conversational AI
❌ Challenge: AI needs to understand context, urgency, and take action—not just chat.

✅ Solution: Context-rich prompting + structured outputs

Every chat message includes:

User's complete profile (major, skills, interests, background)
Current page context (on dashboard? viewing specific opportunity?)
Conversation history (what they've asked before)
Available opportunities in database
Gemini prompt structure:

You are ScholarStream AI. Student profile: [data]. 
They asked: 'I need money urgently'. 

Respond with:
1. Empathetic acknowledgment
2. Search cached opportunities WHERE urgency='immediate' OR deadline < 7 days
3. Prioritize hackathons and bounties (fast turnaround)
4. Return JSON: {message: string, opportunity_ids: []}
5. Actionable next steps

Be conversational, encouraging, specific.

😰 Challenges We Ran Into
1️⃣ The API Quota Crisis ⚠️
The Problem:

Gemini free tier: 15 requests/minute, 1,500/day
Needed to enrich 200+ opportunities
Naive approach: 200 API calls = exhausted quota in 13 minutes
The Panic: Hour 12, we hit rate limits. Dashboard stopped loading. Entire discovery pipeline broken.

The Solution: Creative batch processing:

✅ Send 10 opportunities in a single prompt (not 1)
✅ Gemini returns JSON array with all 10 structured
✅ Reduced 200 calls → 20 calls (90% reduction)
✅ Aggressive caching: enriched data stored in Firebase for 24 hours
✅ Rate limiting on our end: max 10 calls/minute with queuing
Lesson learned: When resources are constrained, batching is your best friend.

2️⃣ The Scraping Nightmare 🕷️
The Problem: Every website has different HTML structure. No standards. One site uses <div class="amount">, another uses <span id="prize">, a third embeds it in paragraph text.

The Frustration: Spent 4 hours writing custom parsers for 5 sites. Realized this wouldn't scale to 100+ sources.

The Breakthrough: Let AI do it:

Scrape entire page content (raw HTML)
Truncate to 10,000 characters (Gemini context limit)
Ask Gemini: "Extract scholarship details from this page"
Gemini's language understanding handles variations in structure
Trade-off: Slower (requires API call per page), but works on ANY site.

Optimization: Only use AI extraction for new/unknown sources. For reliable sources (APIs, well-structured sites), use traditional parsing.

3️⃣ The Empty Dashboard Disaster 😱
The Problem: User completes onboarding, clicks "Show My Opportunities"... blank screen. Nothing.

The Debug Session:

✅ Frontend calling API? Yes, saw request in Network tab
✅ Backend responding? Yes, status 200
✅ Data in response? Yes, array of 50 opportunities
❌ Why no display?? 🤯
The Culprit: Frontend expected field match_percentage, backend returned match_score. Tiny mismatch in data contract = silent failure.

The Fix:

✅ Standardized data schema with TypeScript interfaces
✅ Added validation: log warnings if expected fields missing
✅ Fallback rendering: show partial data even if some fields missing
Lesson learned: Integration bugs are the worst bugs. Test the contract early.

4️⃣ The Real-Time Illusion ⚡
The Problem: Promised "real-time discovery", but scraping 10 websites + AI enrichment takes 30+ seconds. Users won't wait.

The Solution (Perceived Performance):

Instant gratification: Show cached results immediately (<1 second)
Progressive disclosure: Display "Discovering more..." with live progress
"Searching Devpost..." (appears after 2 seconds)
"Analyzing Gitcoin..." (appears after 5 seconds)
"Found 8 new opportunities!" (slide in as they arrive)
Background processing: Live search happens async, doesn't block UI
Result: Feels fast (cached results instant) + feels magical (watching new opportunities appear)

Lesson learned: Performance isn't just about speed—it's about perception.

5️⃣ The Mobile Responsiveness Maze 📱
The Problem: Dashboard looked gorgeous on laptop. Opened on phone: overlapping text, buttons too small, cards cut off—complete disaster.

The Reality Check: Most students browse on phones. If it doesn't work mobile-first, it doesn't work.

The Rebuild:

✅ Redesigned cards for vertical stacking (not horizontal grid)
✅ Increased touch targets to 44×44px minimum
✅ Collapsed sidebar into bottom sheet
✅ Tested on: iPhone SE (smallest), iPhone 15, Android Galaxy
✅ Fixed CSS breakpoints: 640px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px
Lesson learned: "Mobile-first" isn't a suggestion—it's a requirement.

6️⃣ The Context Problem 🤔
The Problem:

User: "Help me apply to this scholarship"

AI: "Which scholarship are you referring to?"

User is ON the scholarship detail page. AI should know.

The Fix: Every chat message now includes:

{
  "message": "Help me apply to this scholarship",
  "context": {
    "current_page": "/opportunity/gates-scholarship-2025",
    "opportunity_id": "gates-2025",
    "user_profile": {...}
  }
}
AI now responds contextually: "I can help you apply to the Gates Scholarship! Let's start with your essay..."

Lesson learned: Context is everything for AI to be truly helpful.

7️⃣ The Deadline Calculation Headache 📅
The Problem: Scraped deadline formats:

"December 15, 2025"
"12/15/2025"
"Closing in 3 weeks"
"Rolling deadline"
"TBD"
JavaScript Date() parsing is inconsistent across browsers.

The Solution:

✅ Normalize everything to ISO 8601: "2025-12-15"
✅ For relative dates ("in 3 weeks"), calculate from current date during enrichment
✅ For "Rolling", store as special value: deadline_type: "rolling"
✅ Store both: deadline (for sorting) + deadline_display (for showing users)
Lesson learned: Dates are harder than they seem. Always use standard formats.

🏆 Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
1. ✅ We Built Something REAL
This isn't vaporware. This isn't a mockup with Lorem Ipsum. ScholarStream is a working product that finds real opportunities from real sources.

When you complete onboarding, you see:

Actual hackathons from Devpost
Actual bounties from Gitcoin
Actual scholarships from verified sources
Every deadline is real. Every prize amount is real. Every application link works.

In 48 hours, we went from idea → deployed product with REAL data.

2. 🚨 We Solved the "Urgent Need" Gap
Every scholarship platform focuses on long-term awards that take 3-6 months. We're the first to address immediate financial need.

Student needs $500 by Friday? We show them:

Hackathons with submissions due this weekend
Bounties they can complete today
Emergency grants with 48-hour turnaround
This shift from "planning ahead" to "helping NOW" is a paradigm change.

3. 🤖 AI That Actually Helps
We didn't build a ChatGPT wrapper. We built an AI that:

✅ Understands context ("I need money urgently" → prioritizes immediate opportunities)
✅ Personalizes based on profile (shows opportunities YOU can actually win)
✅ Takes action (adds to dashboard, starts applications, not just talks)
✅ Searches in real-time (scrapes web live when needed)
Our AI is a tool, not a toy.

4. 💻 Technical Excellence Under Pressure
In 48 hours, we:

✅ Integrated 5+ public APIs (Devpost, Gitcoin, Kaggle, Firebase, Cloudinary)
✅ Built web scrapers for 10+ sources
✅ Implemented AI enrichment pipeline (Gemini)
✅ Created conversational AI chat
✅ Deployed production-ready infrastructure
✅ Made it work flawlessly on mobile
We're not just idea people. We're builders.

5. 🎨 Design That Doesn't Suck
Most hackathon projects have functional but ugly UIs. We refused to compromise.

ScholarStream has:

✅ Consistent design system (colors, spacing, typography)
✅ Smooth animations (confetti on success, cards sliding in)
✅ Accessible UI (WCAG AA compliant, keyboard navigation)
✅ Delightful interactions (hover states, loading skeletons, toast notifications)
✅ Mobile-first responsive design
Judges will want to use this. That's the highest compliment.

6. 📊 We Validated the Problem
This isn't a solution looking for a problem. We lived this problem.

💵 $2.9 billion in unclaimed scholarships? Documented by U.S. Dept of Education.
🎓 Students missing opportunities? I deferred my education because I didn't know about Devpost or Gitcoin.
We built ScholarStream to solve OUR problem. If it helps us, it'll help millions.

7. 📱 It Works on a Phone
80% of students browse on mobile. We tested on:

✅ iPhone (Safari)
✅ Android (Chrome)
✅ Small screens (iPhone SE)
✅ Large screens (iPad)
Every feature works. Every screen is optimized. No compromises.

8. 🚀 We Shipped
The graveyard of hackathons is full of ambitious projects that "almost worked."

We scoped aggressively. We focused on core features. We cut ruthlessly. We shipped a working product.

Shipping > Perfection.

📚 What We Learned
1. Batch Processing is a Superpower ⚡
When facing API rate limits, batching transformed us from "dead in the water" to "fully functional."

Instead of: 1 request = 1 result
We do: 1 request = 10 results

This pattern applies beyond AI:

Database queries: Fetch 50 opportunities at once, not one-by-one
File uploads: Batch multiple documents in single request
Cache invalidation: Clear related caches together
Takeaway: When resources are constrained, think in batches.

2. Real Data > Perfect Features 📊
We could've built 20 features with mock data, or 5 features with real data.

We chose real data. Judges can forgive missing features. They can't forgive fake demos.

Takeaway: Ship working core > feature bloat.

3. AI is a Tool, Not Magic 🤖
Gemini doesn't "just work." It needs:

✅ Clear prompts with examples
✅ Structured output formats (JSON schemas)
✅ Error handling (parsing failures, hallucinations)
✅ Rate limiting (respect quotas)
✅ Fallbacks (when AI unavailable)
Takeaway: Treat AI like any other API—with structure, validation, and resilience.

4. User Experience is Integration 🔗
Our app isn't one brilliant feature. It's the seamless flow between:

Onboarding → Backend discovery → Dashboard display
Dashboard → Opportunity detail → Application workflow
Chat message → Search → Results → Action
Takeaway: Great products are great integrations.

5. Mobile-First Isn't Optional 📱
We built desktop-first initially. Huge mistake. Rebuilding for mobile took 4 hours.

If we'd started mobile-first, we'd have saved time AND ended up with better desktop design (simpler, cleaner).

Takeaway: Start with constraints (mobile), expand to luxury (desktop).

6. Cache Aggressively, Invalidate Smartly 💾
Scraping is slow. API calls are limited. Caching made our app fast:

Opportunities cached for 24 hours
User profiles cached until updated
Chat history cached locally
API responses cached in memory
But: Stale data is worse than slow data. We invalidate when:

User updates profile (new match scores needed)
Manual refresh requested
Scheduled refresh (every 6 hours)
Takeaway: Fast apps cache everything. Smart apps know when to refresh.

7. Context Makes AI Magical ✨
Without context:

User: "Help me apply"
AI: "Apply to what?"

With context:

User: "Help me apply"
AI: "I'll help you apply to the Gates Scholarship. Let's start with your essay..."

Difference? We send opportunity_id and page URL with message.

Takeaway: AI + context = magic. AI - context = frustration.

8. Deployment Matters 🚀
We could've built the best app that only works on localhost:3000.

Instead, we deployed:

Frontend: Vercel (global CDN, edge functions)
Backend: Production server with CORS configured
Database: Firebase (real-time sync)
Files: Cloudinary (optimized delivery)
Takeaway: If judges can't click a link and see it work, it didn't happen.

9. Time Constraints Force Clarity ⏱️
48 hours is brutal. But it forced us to:

Identify core features (discovery, matching, chat)
Cut nice-to-haves (community, recommendations, analytics)
Focus on integration over perfection
Ship working product over feature-complete product
Takeaway: Constraints breed clarity. Unlimited time breeds feature creep.

10. This Problem Matters ❤️
The most important lesson: Students need this.

We're not building a "cool AI project." We're building a lifeline for students who have skills and dreams but miss opportunities due to information asymmetry.

Every line of code we wrote brings us closer to a world where no student has to defer education because they didn't know help existed.

Takeaway: Build things that matter.

🚀 What's Next for ScholarStream

💭 Final Reflection
This project is personal.

Every line of code is written with the memory of sitting at home since March 2025, watching my graduation slip away. Every feature is designed for the student who's refreshing their bank account at 2 AM, wondering how they'll pay tuition tomorrow. Every optimization is for the student on a slow internet connection in a developing country, trying to load opportunities that could change their life.

I built scholarstream because I refuse to let another student experience what I did. I built it because information asymmetry shouldn't determine who gets education and who doesn't. I built it because students/individual with skills, intelligence, and drive are watching their dreams die simply because they don't know opportunities exist.

This is more than a platform. It's a promise.
A promise that when you need money urgently, you'll know there's a hackathon this weekend you can win. A promise that when you're one semester from graduating, you'll discover the scholarship you perfectly qualify for. A promise that when you have skills but no connections, you'll find bounties that value your work.

ScholarStream exists so that no student has to say:

"I had to defer my education because I didn't know."

Now they'll know. Now they'll find. Now they'll win.
